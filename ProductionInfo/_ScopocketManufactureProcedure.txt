Submit Order

Check email for final design so can Confirm it and have boards made.
Usually takes a few hours for email to arrive.
Or on browser tab for PCB Prototype & PCB Fabrication, look for Reviewing to turn into "Review Production File"

To review production file:
Login to jlcpcb (same login as easyeda)
hover over login name and click order history

Note production of boards is done first.  After the boards are made, the placement of parts (soldering) production is done separately.

? Need instructions on the second production step
