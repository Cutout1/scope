# Getting Started
1. Solder on the header pins in the desired configuration if they are missing.
2. Download the latest release MicroPython UF2 for the RP2040 from this page: https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico/
3. Plug the device into your computer using a micro-USB cable.
4. Slide the power switch on the left side of the device to the ON position. A folder should open with two files, "INDEX" and "INFO_UF2".
5. Drag the UF2 file into the folder. The folder will close.
6. Download the Thonny Python IDE, install it, and run it. https://thonny.org/
7. Click the lower right corner of the Thonny window (it may say something like "Local Python 3"), and select "MicroPython RP2040" or "MicroPython Raspberry Pi Pico"
8. Click the stop button near the top of the window.
9. Click the folder button near the top right and open each of the files in the "MicroPython Code" folder in this repository.
10. Save a copy of each of the files to the device. Keep the same filenames.
11. Reboot the device or press the run button in Thonny with main.py open. That's it! Now the code is on the device and will run automatically whenever the device is powered on. Slide the switch from "Ready" to "Start" to begin plotting.
