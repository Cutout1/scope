# jekyll-theme-zendesk-garden

A Jekyll theme using Zendesk Garden design patterns.

This is was initially possible thanks to the following awesome libraries:

- [`jekyll-postcss` plugin](https://github.com/mhanberg/jekyll-postcss)
- [`tailwindcss` as a PostCSS plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#add-tailwind-as-a-post-css-plugin)
- [zendeskgarden/tailwindcss](https://github.com/zendeskgarden/tailwindcss)

> Note: Those have since been removed and any relevant CSS directly included.

## Usage

### GitHub Pages

Define a `_config.yml` file in your GitHub pages directory and specify this remote theme:

```yaml
remote_theme: zendesk/jekyll-theme-zendesk-garden@main
```
