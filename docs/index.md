# Overview

The Scopocket is a combined oscilloscope, function generator, ohmmeter, power supply, and more in a simple and compact package. It is primarily designed to be an educational tool with its main strengths being ease of use and low cost (being manufacturable for less than $20 per unit), with the tradeoff of having a quite limited voltage and frequency range.

The schematics, PCB fabrication files, source code, and case 3D models can all be found in [the GitHub repository.](https://github.com/Cutout1/scope)
