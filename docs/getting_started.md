This page assumes you have a fully assembled and programmed Scopocket. If you do not, please visit [the manufacturing page](https://scopocket.com/manufacturing.html) for information on how to construct one.

For a description of what each pin on the Scopocket does, visit the [pin reference page.](https://scopocket.com/pin_reference.html) The pin reference page also describes the usage of each button and what each mode in the "simple" software version does.

In the future, this page will have a full written explanation with images explaining how to use the Scopocket in depth. For now, please review [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbrOokjkZqg) for a demonstration and explanation.
